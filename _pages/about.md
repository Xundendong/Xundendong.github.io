-	CMI - Detect Behavior with Sensor Data 2025. (Silver Medal 🥈)  This competition focuses on using data from movement, temperature, and proximity sensors on a wrist-worn device to distinguish body-focused repetitive behaviors from similar everyday actions. The goal is to develop predictive models that improve the accuracy and design of wearable BFRB-detection devices, enhancing tools for mental health support.
